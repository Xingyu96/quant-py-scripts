## Algorithmic Trading
I have become interested in this topic ever since I have started trading stocks and ETFs. Now, I have decided to pull the trigger and dive into this field in earnest. I am going to study several books in this topic and compile my learnings into this repository.

In this journey, I will be taking notes in Latex, and applying trading strategies in Python and R. 

### Notes
